/* Nyx senses infrared two different ways, because the Flipper's own IR receiver
 * physically cannot do the whole job.
 *
 *   ONBOARD — the built-in TSOP-75338 on PA0. It is a *demodulating* receiver:
 *     a band-pass filter centered on 38 kHz plus AGC, designed to pull remote
 *     control codes out of a sunlit room. That filter throws away anything that
 *     is not modulated near its center frequency, so a covert camera whose
 *     illuminator runs at steady DC current is INVISIBLE to it, no matter how
 *     bright. What it does catch is anything pulsed: remotes, IR beacons and
 *     link ports, PIR floodlights, and PWM-driven illuminators whose switching
 *     edges carry enough harmonic energy into the passband.
 *
 *   PROBE — an external IR phototransistor on a GPIO ADC pin. A bare junction
 *     has no filter and no AGC, so it responds to steady light. This is the
 *     mode that actually finds a night-vision camera, and it can also tell a
 *     DC illuminator apart from a mains-flickering lamp by looking at ripple.
 *
 * Both paths are listen-only. Nyx never emits IR.
