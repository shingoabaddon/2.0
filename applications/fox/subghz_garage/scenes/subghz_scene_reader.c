/**
 * @file subghz_scene_reader.c
 * @brief Combined Read (auto capture+decode) and Read RAW (manual
 *        record/load/send) scene implementation.
 *
 * Both already drove the same subghz_read_raw view (SubGhzViewIdReadRAW).
 * This merges their scene-level logic into one translation unit to drop
 * the duplicate setup code two separate scene files each carried (status
 * bar, protocol group load, callback wiring, view switch) instead of one.
 *
 * Still two distinct registered scenes - SubGhzSceneReceiver ("Read") and
 * SubGhzSceneReadRAW ("Read RAW"), see subghz_scene.h - so every existing
 * scene_manager_get_scene_state()/has_previous_scene() check elsewhere in
 * this app (the save flow, Receiver Config, More RAW, etc.) that keys off
 * one or the other scene ID keeps working unchanged. SubGhzSceneReceiver's
 * own on_enter/on_event/on_exit are now thin wrappers: on_enter sets
 * subghz->reader_read_mode before delegating into SubGhzSceneReadRAW's
 * handlers below, which check the flag first and branch to Read's logic
 * (subghz_scene_reader_read_on_enter/on_event/on_exit, moved here
 * unchanged from the old subghz_scene_receiver.c) before falling through
 * to Read RAW's own unchanged body. on_exit clears the flag so a later
 * direct entry into SubGhzSceneReadRAW never sees a stale true.

 * then straight back to Listening. Either way the scratch file is deleted
