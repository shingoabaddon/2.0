/**
 * @file subghz_protocol_filter.h
 *
 * Persistent ON/OFF filter for each entry in the SubGHz protocol registry.
 *
 * The filter is a bitmask array: one bit per protocol index.  A protocol
 * whose bit is SET is ENABLED (the default).  A protocol whose bit is
 * CLEARED is disabled and will be skipped during Read decoding.
 *
 * State is saved to /ext/subghz/protocol_filter.save as a plain binary
 * blob.  Missing or corrupt files are silently treated as "all enabled".
 *
 * Maximum protocols supported: SUBGHZ_FILTER_MAX_PROTOCOLS (256).
 * Flipper firmware currently has ~62; the buffer has room to grow.
