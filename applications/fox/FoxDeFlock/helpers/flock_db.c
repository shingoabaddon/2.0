/**
 * 31 OUI prefixes observed in fielded Flock Safety deployments.
 * Mostly @NitekryDPaul research; 82:6b:f2 from DeFlockJoplin field testing;
 * the last entry b4:1e:52 is Flock Safety's own IEEE-registered OUI (GainSec).
 * These are generic vendor prefixes (Liteon, Espressif, etc.), hence OUI-only
 * matches are scored "possible", never "confirmed".
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH is now nitekry/nite-oui-collection ->
 * groups/flockers/my_tested_flock.md, a per-prefix table with Confidence and
 * Status columns. It SUPERSEDES the flat, statusless
 * colonelpanichacks/flock-you -> datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md list this
 * table was originally imported from -- the flat list cannot record that a
 * prefix was later doubted, so re-importing from it silently undoes retractions.
 *
 * RETRACTED UPSTREAM -- never re-add any of these: f8:a2:d6 ("low confidence;
 * hit on a Sony Media Player"), 6c:cd:d6 (Netgear), 94:2a:6f + f4:e2:c6
 * (Ubiquiti), cc:cc:cc (no hits), 00:0c:e7 (possible FP). The flat list still
 * carries some of them, which is exactly why re-importing from it is forbidden.
 *
 * f8:a2:d6 HAS BEEN REMOVED TWICE. Dropped 2026-07-27 for v0.44, then silently
 * re-added by 93beede (2026-08-05) -- a commit about TIGHTENING precision -- while
 * the table was reflowed, and it shipped in v0.67 through v0.71 scoring "Likely"
 * on any wildcard probe. Nothing caught it: the parity gate compared this table
 * against the sketch's and 93beede drifted BOTH sides identically, so 32-vs-32
 * passed while both count comments still said 31. That recurrence is why
 * tools/check_oui_parity.py now also checks the declared count and enforces a
 * retracted-prefix denylist, and why test_flock_db.c asserts each one is absent.
 * A comment is not a guard; treat the denylist as the real rule.
 *
 * This table is a claim of FIELD CORROBORATION. Uncorroborated candidates
 * belong in the user signature file, not here -- see docs/signatures.md.
 *
 * PROVENANCE GRADES. The rows below are NOT uniform evidence, and the ordering
 * is historical, so the grades are listed here rather than inline (the entries
 * would have to be reordered to comment them per row, and reordering both files
 * in lockstep is a worse risk than this list). Full table in docs/signatures.md.
 *   - Contract manufacturer (Liteon/USI), shared with unrelated consumer gear:
 *     f4:6a:dd, 00:f4:8d, d0:39:57, e8:d0:fc. WatchFlock files these separately
 *     from direct-Flock prefixes and warns a MAC match alone may be a FP.
 *   - Flat-list orphans, absent from the curated table in EVERY section (not
 *     Active, not testing, not Removed): 70:08:94, 58:00:e3, 5c:93:a2, 64:6e:69.
 *     Kept because absence is not retraction, but their status is unverifiable.
 *   - Weak upstream confidence: 08:3a:88 ("BLE Ring conflict - unsure"),
 *     48:27:ea + a4:cf:12 ("low, WiGLE crowdsource"). These three do NOT meet
 *     the field-corroboration bar this table's first line claims.
 * Nothing here changes scoring: an OUI-only match caps at "possible" regardless.
 *
 * DUPLICATED in esp32_companion/flock_companion/flock_companion.ino, which
 * scores ESP-side. No shared header is possible (that side is an Arduino
 * sketch), so change BOTH and keep the row layout identical -- EXACTLY four
 * entries per row -- so they can be diffed by eye. tools/check_oui_parity.py
 * enforces content parity as a required CI gate; the row layout is on you.

 * That is not hypothetical: it is exactly how v0.46 shipped "Flock-Guest" as
 * CONFIRMED with every test green. Rather than leave a second, diverging ladder
 * around to be maintained and mistaken for the real one, the assertions moved to
 * esp_parse_companion_line() in test/test_esp_parser.c, where they exercise the
 * boundary the product actually uses.
